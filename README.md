- Organized by "World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association (WCPCA)"
- Cancelled multiple times due to injuries, legal and logistics issues
- Restarted in 2023 in Vinita, Oklahoma

# Punkin Chunkin' Categories

- Air cannon
- Catapult
- Torsion
- Centrifugal
- Trebuchet

# Air Cannon

If you ever built a potato gun or at least had the opportunity to shoot one, Air Cannons at the annual Punkin Chunkin are the big daddy of potato guns. Using compressed air, nothing flamable, these machines shoot pumpkins over 4,000 feet

# Catapult

Similar to a Trebuchet in terms of an arm swinging a pumpkin around attached to a sling, with the exception that these machines are normally powered by springs or rubber bands

# Torsion

A Torsion machine is any device that uses twisted rope as its primary source of power. It relies on a rope that works by torsion or twisting. The rope stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. The amount of force it releases is proportional to the amount it is twisted.

---

# Centrifugal

These machines build up centrifugal force in an circular motion and have ways to release the pumpkin at the optimal trajectory for an outstanding distance shot.

# Trebuchet

Powered exclusively by gravity, these machines use a counterweight attached to an arm to swing the pumpkin attached to a sling around and release at an optimal pin angle.

# Human Powered

![bg right:50% w:600](img/human-powered.png)

Machines can use any kind of stored energy that can be stored by a single person in two minutes.

# Safety

![bg right:50% w:600](img/james-death-ball.png)

- "Cone of Danger"
- "If a pumpkin weighing 5 pounds were to be thrown at someone at a velocity of 10 meters per second, it could potentially cause injury upon impact." (Credit ChatGPT)

# Factors in building

- Mass of counterweight
- Mass of ballistics
- Drop distance
- Release Angle
- And so much more...

---

# How/where do I get started?

* Pick a design
  - Recommendation: Hinged counterweight (10 lbs)
* Start small
  - Recommendation: Baseball (5 oz)
* Experiment + Learn
  - Recommendation: Outside (200 feet)
* Go bigger
  - Recommendation: Safety
