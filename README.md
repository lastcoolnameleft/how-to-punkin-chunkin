# Vocabulary

From Wikipedia:
* [Catapult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult) - a ballistic device used to launch a projectile a great distance without the aid of gunpowder or other propellants
* [Trebuchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet) - uses a rotating arm with a sling attached to the tip to launch a projectile
* A trebuchet is a type of catapult
  - e.g. All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares

# Vocabulary

- Accuracy - ability to hit the intended target
- Precision - ability to hit same spot

# Air Cannon

If you ever built a potato gun or at least had the opportunity to shoot one, Air Cannons at the annual Punkin Chunkin are the big daddy of potato guns. Using compressed air, nothing flamable, these machines shoot pumpkins over 4,000 feet

---

# Centrifugal

These machines build up centrifugal force in an circular motion and have ways to release the pumpkin at the optimal trajectory for an outstanding distance shot.

# Torsion (e.g. Onager)

A Torsion machine is any device that uses twisted rope as its primary source of power. It relies on a rope that works by torsion or twisting. The rope stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. The amount of force it releases is proportional to the amount it is twisted.

# Trebuchet - History

French for "overturn".

Earliest ones seen in China ~4th century BC (powered by men on ropes: traction trebuchet).  Counterweight replaced people ~12th century.

# Trebuchet

Modern trebuchets are powered by gravity, and use a counterweight attached to an arm to swing the ballistic attached to a sling around and release at an optimal angle.

# Trebuchet types

- Fixed counterweight
- Hinged counterweight
- Floating Arm
- MURLIN
- Human powered
- And many more

---

# Fixed Counterweight Trebuchet

![bg right:50% w:600](img/fixed-counterweight-trebuchet.png)

- Weight is attached directly to the arm
- Weight drops in an arc

<!--

-->

# Hinged Counterweight Trebuchet (traditional)

![bg right:50% w:600 h:700](img/hinged-counterweight-trebuchet.png)

- Weight is atached to a pivot point on the arm
- This enabled a better "drop" of the weight
- Frame on wheels helps ensure more force is delivered to ballistic

# Human Powered

![bg right:50% w:600](img/human-powered.png)

Machines can use any kind of stored energy that can be stored by a single person in two minutes.

# Safety

![bg right:50% w:600](img/james-death-ball.png)

- "Cone of Danger"
  - e.g. danger zones of a horse
- Invest in good firing mechanisms
  - e.g. snap shackles
- Treat loaded catapult like loaded gun
- Pre-flight checks
- AVOID DRY FIRING
- Checks structrual integrity after each launch

[Safety example](https://photos.app.goo.gl/e4ge751RjLEJye6G9)

# Pre-Flight Checks

![bg right:50% w:600](img/punkin-chunkin-safety-inspection.jpeg)

Example:
- Safety on
- Ballistic loaded properly
- No twisted or obstructed rope
- Range is clear
- Nothing valuable in "cone of danger"

# Physics

- Guinness world record: pneumatic cannon at 5,500+ feet
- Pie-ing a pumpkin (i.e. "pumpkin pie in the sky")

![bg right:50% w:600](img/range-formula.png)

---

# Factors in building

- Everything in previous formula
- Release Angle
- Distance of axle to counterweight and sling
- Length of sling
- Materials used
- Rope will stretch
- ...

---

# How/where do I get started?

- Pick a design
  - Recommendation: Hinged counterweight (10 lbs)
- Start small
  - Recommendation: Baseball (5 oz) or Tennis ball (2 oz)
- Experiment + Learn
  - Recommendation: Outside (200 feet)
- Go bigger
  - Recommendation: Safety

# Lumber

- Get started with Common boards (e.g. pine) from Home Depot / Lowes
  - Don't get treated wood (arsenic)
- Listed in depth and width (e.g. 1x3, 2x4, 1x8, etc.)
- Board is cut THEN planed (to make straight-ish)
  - e.g. 2x4 is NOT 2"x4".  Actually about 1.5" x 3.5"
  - e.g. 1x4 is .75" x 3.5"
- Pilot holes are your friend

# Pro Tips

Think in terms of a constructing a vessel and label pieces accordingly

- Foreward = where the ballistic is directed towards
- Stern / Aft = backside, opposite of foreward
- Port = When facing forward, on the left
- Starbord = When facing forward, on the right
